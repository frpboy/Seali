# Seali maintenance status

## Published alpha

[Seali 2.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5) is the first public prerelease from this fork. Its package is `com.frpboy.seali`; the launcher branding and developer/support identity have been changed to Seali. That published build used the earlier internal source namespace. Current source preparation moves owned packages to `com.frpboy.seali` while retaining only necessary upgrade bridges; it does not change the application ID or qualify an installed update. See [namespace migration notes](docs/migration/owned-namespace-migration.md).

The five actual public APKs were downloaded after publication and checked against GitHub's SHA256 asset digests, the Seali signing certificate, package/version and 16KB ZIP alignment. The known embedded upstream credential fragments were absent from those APKs. These targeted checks are not a complete security audit.

The final cleanup APK has not yet been device-tested. Earlier user recordings demonstrated Classic/v2 switching in both directions on an earlier build. Do not treat that as proof of all final-build behavior.

## Current qualification gates

- Classic correctness follow-up [PR14](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/14) is merged on main after exact-head CI passed. It is not included in the published alpha.
- The compact Classic header from [PR15](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/15) was incorporated through merged PR21; PR15 is closed as superseded, not merged separately. Device layout/accessibility qualification remains open. Recreate-preserving transition polish is separate unfinished work.
- Play storage and manual-update UI paths remain open. Play variants are for Google Play distribution only, never GitHub downloads or Actions artifacts. No Play publication or policy-compliance claim.
- About cleanup [PR16](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/16) is merged on main: duplicate donation rows are removed and Support requests opens the maintainer-provided Telegram group. This is not in the published alpha. About localization, translated sponsorship wording and content-URI file-size lookup still need follow-up.
- Historical review feedback is being revalidated against source. A passing build does not resolve every review thread.

Preserve the upstream GPL license, credits and meaningful history. Report fork-specific problems to this repository. The original project and its community do not operate this fork's support channels.

## Maintenance update: 2026-11-09

- [PR31](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/31) merged the Seali-specific community documentation and translation contribution route. [PR32](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/32) corrected public maintainer contact to `frpboy12@gmail.com`; the earlier address was incorrect. These documentation changes do not update published APKs.
- App contact, translation and upstream-credit changes in [PR30](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/30) remain unmerged pending actual visual qualification. Test builds and installation succeeded in the initial capture checks, but no complete screenshot set has been recovered. A later capture with a corrected lazy-list test harness stopped during dependency download, before app compilation or instrumentation. The harness correction is therefore not runtime-qualified; no visual pass is claimed. This is not full app-navigation, native-runtime, accessibility or all-locale qualification.
- README sponsor buttons in [PR33](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/pull/33) remain an open proposal, separate from the current sidebar configuration in `.github/FUNDING.yml`. Financial support remains optional and separate from help requests.
- [Issue 34](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/issues/34) is an open, unassigned good first issue for the exactly-one-hour duration boundary and local JVM tests. The source finding is not a shipped fix or a device-test result.
- Work toward source-built native packages is a source-review checkpoint only. There is no qualified replacement AAR, admitted native build or new published package. See [native dependency provenance](docs/NATIVE_DEPENDENCY_PROVENANCE.md) for the existing payload evidence and remaining limits.

Current status belongs here; dated audits and earlier release notes remain historical records. Passing a documentation build does not close app or release gates.

## Release preparation: 2026-11-09

- Source version is 2.0.0-alpha.6 (base version code 200000160); the latest published build is still alpha.5. No new version has been released.
- Documentation update PR35 is merged. Its exact-source CI and postmerge CI passed unit tests, release packaging and signature checks. APK uploads and history UI were skipped, with no retained artifacts; these runs are not release or device evidence.
- A current-main screenshot qualification composition is prepared privately, without an encryption recipient. Capture execution remains paused, with no active capture run or retry watch. Later build success did not prove a fresh fetch of the exact dependency that stopped the last capture.
- The next release must be built and qualified on its exact source and binaries. Unmerged PR30/PR33 changes, the open duration issue and local native recipes must not be listed as shipped. Replacing inherited dependencies with owned native builds is separate work, not an automatic requirement to include unfinished replacement code in the next release; existing native/security, source and notice obligations still apply.
