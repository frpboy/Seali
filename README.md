**Seali** is an independently maintained Android video and audio downloader.

This repository is maintained by [Rahul Muraleedharan (@frpboy)](https://github.com/frpboy).

> **Project status:** [Seali 2.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5) is available as an alpha prerelease. The app uses the Seali identity and `com.frpboy.seali` package. The final cleanup build still needs device testing; it is not a stable or Play-qualified release. Later changes on main are not automatically included in those published APKs.

## Current maintenance and next release

The current source version is **2.0.0-alpha.6**, but it has not been published. The latest public APKs remain alpha.5. Documentation/contact corrections and merged Classic/About maintenance on main do not update an installed alpha.5 APK. See [current status](SEALI_STATUS.md) and the [Seali changelog](CHANGELOG.md#seali-maintenance-unreleased) for completed source changes and release limits.

The About/contact/translation changes in PR30 and queue-clarity changes in PR38 remain unmerged and await visual checks. The README sponsor buttons (PR33) and view-counter/safe-CI changes (PR39) are merged source maintenance, not new app releases. Native source-build preparation has not replaced the inherited dependencies. A new release needs exact-source signed APKs and the applicable runtime, native/security, source and notice checks; green documentation CI alone is not release qualification.

## Download and use

Download an APK from the [alpha release page](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5). It provides universal, ARM64, ARMv7, x86 and x86_64 builds. Choose universal if unsure. Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer is required by the current build configuration. Seali installs separately from upstream Seal; upstream app data does not migrate automatically.

Paste a supported video link and tap Download, then choose the desired options. The interface can be switched between Classic and v2 in Settings > Appearance > Interface. Finish or cancel active downloads before switching.

Read [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the JDK 21/SDK 36 setup, real test commands, flavors and signing requirements. [SEALI_STATUS.md](SEALI_STATUS.md) distinguishes published checks from remaining device, storage and review gates.

## Screenshots

Actual user-device captures of **Seali 2.0.0-alpha.6**, supplied on November 9, 2026. The navigation and configuration views are cropped to Seali-only UI for privacy. No UI has been repainted or recreated. These captures show an installed alpha build, not qualification of the latest source or a new public release.

## About

Seali is based on the original Seal application, a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Android interface for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

The inherited feature set includes:

- Download video and audio from websites supported by yt-dlp.
- Extract audio and embed supported metadata and thumbnails.
- Download playlists.
- Use the bundled aria2c external downloader.
- Embed subtitles in downloaded videos.
- Create and run custom yt-dlp command templates.
- Manage downloads and command templates.
- Material Design 3 interface with dynamic color support.

These are inherited capabilities. Current compatibility and functionality will be revalidated as part of the Seali maintenance work.

## Thanks and credits

Upstream authorship, historical references and required license notices are centralized in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Attribution and project identity

Seali is independently maintained and is not an official upstream release. Please report Seali-specific issues in this repository. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for original authorship, history and required notices.

## Development

The project uses Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Gradle. Owned source packages use `com.frpboy.seali`. The installed application ID remains `com.frpboy.seali`; debug/preview suffixes are unchanged. Minimal legacy type IDs and Android component bridges remain for upgrade compatibility, not branding. See [namespace migration notes](docs/migration/owned-namespace-migration.md) for the remaining qualification gates. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) before changing build or signing configuration.

Before submitting changes:

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the repository's contribution conventions.
2. Keep changes focused and include tests where practical.
3. Clearly identify inherited behavior versus new Seali-specific changes.
4. Preserve all third-party copyright and license notices.
5. Do not claim that a feature is supported until it has been tested on the current codebase.

On main, PR16 keeps these options under the single Sponsor entry. The published alpha predates that cleanup and still has the duplicate About donation rows.
