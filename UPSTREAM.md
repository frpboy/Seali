# Upstream provenance and maintenance

## Origin

This repository continues work based on:

- Project: original open-source Android downloader (see [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md))
- Original author: documented in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)
- Original license: GNU General Public License v3.0
- Upstream default branch: `main`

## Continuation maintainer

- Project continuation: **Seali**
- Maintainer: **Rahul Muraleedharan**
- GitHub: [@frpboy](https://github.com/frpboy)

## Attribution and licensing policy

1. Preserve the original Git history wherever possible.
2. Keep the GPL-3.0 license and existing copyright notices intact.
3. Do not represent upstream code as original Seali-authored work.
4. Identify substantial Seali changes in commit messages, release notes, and documentation.
5. Keep a clear record of imported upstream changes and their source commits.
6. Clearly mark modified builds and comply with GPL-3.0 source-distribution requirements.
7. Do not use upstream branding, artwork, release channels, or community identity in a way that implies endorsement.

## Maintenance policy

Seali will maintain its own issue triage, roadmap, testing, release process, and documentation. Upstream changes may be reviewed and selectively integrated after compatibility and security checks. An upstream sync must never silently overwrite Seali-specific fixes.

## Current identity and compatibility

The repository is now standalone at [frpboy/Seali](https://github.com/frpboy/Seali). Seali uses the installed application ID `com.frpboy.seali`; the published alpha and later main changes are distinguished in [SEALI_STATUS.md](SEALI_STATUS.md). Detaching or renaming the repository does not replace inherited dependencies or qualify a new binary.

Upstream authorship, historical references and required notices are centralized in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md). Owned Kotlin namespaces now use `com.frpboy.seali` in source preparation. Minimal legacy upgrade identifiers and real dependency coordinates remain where required; they do not identify Seali as an official upstream release. Source migration is not an installed/runtime qualification.
