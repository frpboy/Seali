# Interface settings organization source candidate

Local child of preset5d706332. The actual Classic/v2 selector moves to Interface & interaction alongside initial download type. Appearance keeps a familiar navigational shortcut to that page, not a second selector. Hub subtitle describes both choices.

The original selector body, confirmation dialog and selectable choice rows are copied byte-for-byte to the new composable. Saved mode/defaults, saveable dialog selection, explicit confirmation/cancel, actual active-download guard, warning, updateUiStyle and Activity recreation stay unchanged. This preserves the original guard's existing scope; it does not claim a new Classic-active-task or migration qualification. No forced mode switch or preference/data rewrite.

60source assertions across17suites pass, including retained guard/choice expectations adapted to their new source location. Independent extraction verified the original selector body/dialog/choice are exact matches. Exact child Android/Compose, navigation/back, mode confirmation/cancel/active tasks, saved state, Classic/v2, compact/RTL/fontscale/pixels/runtime remain open. No remote update or new workflow yet; wider roadmap remains active.

Lifecycle caveat: rememberSaveable state now belongs to the Interaction destination, not Appearance. Navigation/back-stack lifetime changes intentionally with that move; restoration and guard races require actual qualification. Byte-identical bodies are not proof of unchanged lifecycle.
